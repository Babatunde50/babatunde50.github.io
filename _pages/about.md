I’m **Babatunde Ololade**, a Research Assistant at the [Parallel Systems (PARS) Research Group](https://pars.iyte.edu.tr/) at İzmir Institute of Technology (İYTE), Turkey.  
My work focuses on **GPU-accelerated and heterogeneous parallel computing**, **CUDA kernel optimization**, and **scalable deep learning systems**.

I earned my **B.Sc. in Software Engineering** from Haliç University, Istanbul, where my thesis introduced a Git-enabled assignment submission system that reduced grading time by 38% and storage costs by 43%. The work later evolved into a peer-reviewed publication and a [preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06363).

At PARS, I work on CUDA-based performance benchmarking for both discrete GPUs and Jetson embedded devices, profiling kernels with NVIDIA Nsight Systems/Compute, and building Dockerized GPU environments to support reproducible research.

I’m currently preparing to pursue a **Ph.D. in Computer Science** in the United States, beginning in **Fall 2026**, with research interests centered on **high-performance computing**, **parallel runtime systems**, and **scalable machine learning frameworks**.  
My goal is to contribute to the design of efficient, transparent, and fair systems that bridge the gap between software performance and real-world scalability.

Outside research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring students in web and systems programming, and collaborating on open-source projects that make advanced computing more accessible.
